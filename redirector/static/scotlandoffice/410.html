          <p>On 30th January 2013 the website for the Scotland Office was replaced by <a href='http://www.gov.uk/scotland-office'>gov.uk/scotland-office</a>. <a href='https://www.gov.uk'>GOV.UK</a> is now the best place to find government services and information.</p>

          <p>GOV.UK does not cover every piece of content that used to be found on the website for the Scotland Office. The page you are looking for is probably one of these.</p>

          <p>Essential government services and information can be found at <a href='https://www.gov.uk'>GOV.UK</a>.</p>

          <p>A copy of the page you were looking for can be found in <a href="http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20130130150421/www.scotlandoffice.gov.uk<?= $_SERVER['REQUEST_URI'] ?>">The UK Government Web Archive</a>, however it will not be updated after 30th January 2013.</p>
